* use automated documentation
* try cmake, at least to compare with meson build
* use noncopyable classes, currently it is impossible because of boost::fusion::transform
* separate output logic from the core algorithms
* write normal readme.md

Lesser priority:
* make the async part of code compile in windows' clang
* test agains gcc 6.0
* compile to AsmJS
