* use static analyzer
* use automated documentation
* check hana
* use variable templates?, they are supported by GCC but not MSVC 2015
* try cmake, at least to compare with meson build
* test agains gcc/clang, compile for JS (c++17 might be a problem)
* use ublas
* use noncopyable classes, currently it is impossible because of boost::fusion::transform
* make thread pool based implementation
* separate output logic from the core algorithms
* use profiler, check https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/10/29/profile-your-cpu-in-the-debugger-in-visual-studio-2015/ for example
* use code coverage during tests. See gcov
* use clang static analyzer, see https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/wiki/Cheat%20sheet#using-clang-static-analyzer
* check other features here: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/wiki/Feature%20autodetection
